## Persistent Storage
# When creating persistent storage, the NiFi helm chart can either reference an already-defined
# storage class by name, such as "standard" or can define a custom storage class by specifying
# the storage class name as "nifi-storage-class" and providing the "storageProvisioner" and "storageType".
# For example, to use SSD storage on Google Compute Engine, we would use the following settings:
# storageClass: nifi-storage-class
# storageProvisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
# storageType: pd-ssd
#
# To use a storage class that already exists on the Kubernetes cluster, we can simply reference it by name.
# For example:
# storageClass: standard
#
storageClass: standard

## Storage Capacities for persistent volumes
# Storage capacity for the 'data' directory, which is used to hold things such as the flow.xml.gz, configuration, state, etc.
dataStorage: 1Gi
# Storage capacity for the FlowFile repository
flowfileRepoStorage: 10Gi
# Storage capacity for the Content repository
contentRepoStorage: 10Gi
# Storage capacity for the Provenance repository. When changing this, one should also change the properties.provenanceStorage value above, also.
provenanceRepoStorage: 10Gi
# Storage capacity for nifi logs
logStorage: 5Gi

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #  cpu: 100m
